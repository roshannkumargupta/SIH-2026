In each year, she collects coins:\n\n• Year 1: She collects 5 coins\n• Year 2: She collects 11 coins (5 + 6)\n• Year 3: She collects 23 coins (11 + 12)\n• Year 4: She collects 47 coins (23 + 24)\n\nThe pattern continues: each year she collects the previous total plus double the year number.\n\nHow many coins does she collect in Year 6?",
    answer: 191,
    hint: "💡 Year 5: 47 + 48 = 95. Year 6: 95 + 96 = 191",
    explanation: "Following the pattern:\n\n🪙 Year 1: 5 coins\n🪙 Year 2: 5 + 6 = 11 coins (added 2×3)\n🪙 Year 3: 11 + 12 = 23 coins (added 2×6)\n🪙 Year 4: 23 + 24 = 47 coins (added 2×12)\n🪙 Year 5: 47 + 48 = 95 coins (added 2×24)\n🪙 Year 6: 95 + 96 = 191 coins (added 2×48)\n\nThe pattern shows we're adding double the previous addition each time.\n\n✅ Answer: 191 coins"
